Welcome to the 1st iteration of Portfolio. 

Built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

## TL;DR
Yes, you can fork this, as long as you don't _plegise_ and provide some attribution.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

## Thats all folks

Like any other Next.js projects, running this locally you can access it on port 3000.
